# Automatic-biling-cart

INTRODUCTION :
              Shopping, especially during busy times, often involves long waits at checkout counters, which can be frustrating for customers. To address this issue, the project proposes an automatic billing system integrated into shopping carts. This system leverages RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology to automate the checkout process directly within the cart, offering a streamlined and efficient shopping experience.

SYSTEM OVERVIEW:
             The proposed system centers around a smart shopping cart equipped with an Arduino microcontroller, an RFID reader, and an LCD display. The RFID reader scans RFID tags attached to products in the store, while the LCD screen provides real-time updates of the total cost of items in the cart. This setup aims to reduce the time customers spend in queues and enhances the shopping experience by automating the billing process.

COMPONENTS AND OPERATION:
1.Arduino Nano: This compact microcontroller serves as the brain of the system, managing the interactions between the RFID reader and the LCD screen. It processes the scanned data and updates the display accordingly.
2.RFID Reader and Tags: Each product in the store is tagged with an RFID tag, which contains information about the product's identity and price. The RFID reader scans these tags when they are placed in the cart, retrieving the necessary information to update the total cost.
3.LCD Screen with I2C Module: This display shows the ongoing total price of the items in the cart. The I2C module allows for easy communication between the Arduino and the LCD screen.
4.Buzzer and LED Indicators: These components provide feedback to the user. The buzzer sounds when a product is successfully scanned, and LEDs light up to signal various statuses such as successful scans or errors.

The system operates by scanning each RFID tag as products are added or removed from the cart. The Arduino processes the tag data, updates the total cost, and displays this information on the LCD screen. This allows customers to keep track of their spending in real-time without needing to wait for traditional checkout.

LIBRARIES USED:
<SPI.h>: Provides functions for SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) communication between the microcontroller and peripheral devices.
<MFRC522.h>: Handles communication with the MFRC522 RFID reader, enabling RFID tag reading and writing.
<LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>: Facilitates communication with LCD displays via I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), allowing text to be displayed on the screen.
<Wire.h>: Manages I2C communication, supporting data transfer between the microcontroller and I2C devices.

PROBLEM DEFINITION
Traditional checkout processes using barcode scanners can be slow, leading to long queues and customer dissatisfaction. RFID technology offers a solution by enabling faster and more efficient tracking of products. The primary goal of this project is to reduce the time spent in checkout lines and improve the overall shopping experience by automating the billing process directly within the cart.

METHODOLOGY:
The system is built around an Arduino-based controller that interfaces with an RFID reader and an LCD screen. The RFID reader scans product tags, which are then processed by the Arduino to update the display with the current total price. This real-time processing eliminates the need for manual checkout, reducing wait times and improving customer satisfaction.


ADVANTAGES:
Faster Billing: The automated system reduces the time spent at checkout by processing transactions in real-time as items are added to the cart.
Real-Time Price Updates: Customers can see the total cost of their purchases immediately, which helps in managing their budget.
Enhanced Shopping Experience: The streamlined process reduces the stress and wait times associated with traditional checkout counters.

DISADVANTAGES:
Dependency on Smart Cart: The system requires customers to use the smart cart for tracking purchases, which may not be convenient for those buying a single item.
Maintenance and Costs: Regular maintenance and battery replacements are necessary for the RFID components, adding to the operational costs.

CONCLUSION:
The integration of RFID technology into shopping carts presents a significant improvement over traditional checkout methods. By automating the billing process and providing real-time updates, the system enhances the shopping experience and reduces wait times. While there are some challenges, such as the need for regular maintenance and potential inconvenience for single-item purchases, the benefits of faster and more accurate billing are substantial. Future developments could focus on expanding the RFID range and incorporating additional features to further improve the system's efficiency.
